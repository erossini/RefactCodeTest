# Engineering Code Test

Thank you for applying to Sonovate and participating in the code test for us! 

The goal of this test is to demonstrate your ability to refactor an existing codebase to adhere to best practices
and good engineering principles. The resulting solution should be closer to what you consider to be production 
grade code. There are a few constraints since its currently being used by services outside of this solution:

* You cannot change Application.cs
* You cannot change CandidateRepository
* You cannot change InvoiceTransactionRepository
* You cannot change PaymentsRepository

* You can change BacsExportService
* You can create/delete/change any Domain/ classes

Please make a reasonable attempt to address the concerns you have with the existing codebase and if you run
out of time please include a list of issues and the next steps that you would take to address them.
