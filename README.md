# Refact Engineering Code Test

Thank you for applying and participating in the code test for us! 

The goal of this test is to demonstrate your ability to refactor an existing codebase to adhere to best practices
and good engineering principles. The resulting solution should be closer to what you consider to be production 
grade code. There are a few constraints since its currently being used by services outside of this solution:

* You cannot change Application.cs
* You cannot change CandidateRepository
* You cannot change InvoiceTransactionRepository
* You cannot change PaymentsRepository

* You can change BacsExportService
* You can create/delete/change any Domain/ classes

Please make a reasonable attempt to address the concerns you have with the existing codebase and if you run
out of time please include a list of issues and the next steps that you would take to address them.

## Other info
The test should take around 1hr 30 – 2 hrs, though of course if you can spend some more time on it to make sure it’s the highest quality of work that would be great.

Though it isn’t timed, essentially they want you to work on the test until you think it is production ready.

Once finished, please upload it to GitHub and send the link to me not Sonovate (please don’t mention in the file when uploading it that it is the Sonovate tech test).

I tend to look for candidates with good knowledge and experience with the below, so try and incorporate these into your test:

- Open/Close, Single Responsibility, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion Principles
- DRY, KISS and YAGNI
- Tell Don’t Ask
- Backwards Compatibility
- Tests that are isolated and don’t affect each other
